# Increasing-Trust-In-a-Shared-and-Traded-Control-Paradigm-Using-Explainable-AI
I am writing another paper focused on increasing human trust in collaborative robotics.  The paper is similar to my prevous work but uses a more complex and capable robot for collaboration.  This repo will house the paper as it is written as well as include experimental analysis.  The repo will be taken down before submission to CASE IEEE Conference on March 29.
