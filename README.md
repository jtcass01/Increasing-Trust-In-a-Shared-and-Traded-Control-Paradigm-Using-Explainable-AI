# Increasing-Trust-In-a-Shared-and-Traded-Control-Paradigm-Using-Explainable-AI
I am writing another paper focused on increasing human trust in collaborative robotics.  This repo will house the paper as it is written as well as include experimental analysis.  It will be taken down before submission to CASE IEEE Conference on March 29.
